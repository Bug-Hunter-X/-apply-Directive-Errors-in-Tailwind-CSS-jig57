# @apply Directive Errors in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive, specifically within custom directives. The error arises when attempting to apply a class that is not defined within your Tailwind configuration file. This can lead to unexpected behavior or build errors during development.

## Problem
The primary issue revolves around using `@apply` with classes that aren't part of your Tailwind setup.  Incorrect usage or typos can also cause unexpected issues.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure that all classes used within `@apply` directives are properly defined and configured. Additionally, double-check for any typos or incorrect class names.
